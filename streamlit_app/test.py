#
#     The name of the function ("long_running_function")
#     The value of the inputs (param1, param2)
#     The code within the function
#
# Before running the code within long_running_function, Streamlit checks its cache for a previously saved result.
# If it finds a cached result for the given function and input values, it will return that cached result and not rerun function's code.
# Otherwise, Streamlit executes the function, saves the result in its cache, and proceeds with the script run.
# During development, the cache updates automatically as the function code changes, ensuring that the latest changes are reflected in the cache.

# '''
# Session State provides a dictionary-like interface where you can save information that is preserved between script reruns.
# Use st.session_state with key or attribute notation to store and recall values.
# For example, st.session_state["my_key"] or st.session_state.my_key.
# Remember that widgets handle their statefulness all by themselves, so you won't always need to use Session State!
#
# First run: The first time the app runs for each user, Session State is empty. Therefore, a key-value pair is created ("counter":0).
# As the script continues, the counter is immediately incremented ("counter":1) and the result is displayed: "This page has run 1 times."
# When the page has fully rendered, the script has finished and the Streamlit server waits for the user to do something. When that user clicks the button, a rerun begins.
#
# Second run: Since "counter" is already a key in Session State, it is not reinitialized. As the script continues, the counter is incremented ("counter":2) and the result is displayed: "This page has run 2 times."
#
# There are a few common scenarios where Session State is helpful.
# As demonstrated above, Session State is used when you have a progressive process that you want to build upon from one rerun to the next.
# Session State can also be used to prevent recalculation, similar to caching. However, the differences are important:
#
# Caching associates stored values to specific functions and inputs. Cached values are accessible to all users across all sessions.
# Session State associates stored values to keys (strings). Values in session state are only available in the single session where it was saved.
# If you have random number generation in your app, you'd likely use Session State. Here's an example where data is generated randomly at the beginning of each session.
# By saving this random information in Session State, each user gets different random data when they open the app but it won't keep changing on them as they interact with it.
# If you select different colors with the picker you'll see that the data does not get re-randomized with each rerun.
# (If you open the app in a new tab to start a new session, you'll see different data!)
